## Introduction

The "Tic Tac Toe" program is a popular game that allows users to play against a computer or engage in a 1 vs 1 match on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to align three of your chosen symbols (typically "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Setup

You only need the appropriate version of python and its libraries,  running in your IDLE environment (I recommend Visual studio code or PyCharm)
